Hey guys I'm new to git hub came here to learn how to create things. I'm interested in learning how to program/code and  pretty much how to use my device in general, I've been trying out Bitcoin/cryptocurrency lately and came across a page that says you can make you own coin I just want to know if that is true and if so would anyone like to learn this with me?
